# Log Export Bot

A Discord bot to help export messages from a channel and DM a text file to the user.
Open-source and extracted snippet from Quingeebot! It's very simple but it gets
the job done. Feel free to contact Froggo (shuttlefrog#8644) for support.

## Installation and Usage

Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/tpeng3/logexportbot.git`
and install the node packages.

If you don't have node installed go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```bash
npm install
```

Add the Discord bot token, client ID and the server's guild ID in a `
env` file.
If you don't know what those are, you can reference the guide [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).

In the terminal, run `node bot` to start the bot and listen in user commands.
It'll work as long as the process is running. If you want to keep the bot on
even when your computer is asleep, I recommend checking out bot hosting services.
(Fly.io is a free option for it)
